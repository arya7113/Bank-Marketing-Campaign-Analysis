## 🏁 Project Overview
This project is part of the **MLP T32024** competition hosted by *iitmbscs2008p*. The objective is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit (`"yes"` or `"no"`), based on their personal and campaign interaction features.

The data is sourced from real-world marketing campaigns and includes various attributes such as job, marital status, contact type, campaign duration, etc.

## 🧪 Task
- Train a machine learning model to predict the **target** (`"yes"` or `"no"`) for unseen test data.
- Submit predictions in the format specified by `sample_submission.csv`.

## 🛠️ Workflow Summary
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Model training using a basic machine learning algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation using **macro F1 Score**
- Final predictions saved and submitted in the required format

## 🧠 Model Performance
- **Best Submission Score:** `F1 Score (macro) = 0.7678`
